# Frontend Issues Resolution Summary

## GitHub Issue #2: Dashboard Data Loading Failures

This document summarizes the investigation and resolution of GitHub Issue #2, which reported failures in dashboard data loading and related frontend issues.

## Issue Investigation

Using JAM debug sessions, we identified several issues in the frontend codebase:

1. **API Endpoint Misconfigurations**: Inconsistent API path usage across different components.
2. **Error Handling Deficiencies**: Inadequate error handling in API calls, causing silent failures.
3. **Connectivity Issues**: Problems with API connectivity and proper URL formation.

## Resolution Steps

### 1. API Configuration Audit

- Reviewed and standardized API URL configuration in `frontend/src/config/index.js`
- Ensured consistent base URL formation in `apiUtils.js`
- Verified that the API base URL correctly includes `/api` prefix

### 2. Error Handling Improvements

- Enhanced error handling in `useApi` hook to provide better error information
- Added toast notifications for API failures in Dashboard and other components
- Implemented retry logic for critical data fetching operations

### 3. Component-Specific Fixes

#### Dashboard

- Fixed endpoint usage in `useDashboardData.js`
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Implemented refresh functionality for dashboard statistics

#### History

- Corrected API endpoint paths in History component
- Enhanced error state display and retry mechanisms

#### Job Tracker

- Fixed API path issues in `jobTrackerService.js`
- Improved error handling in Job Tracker components

#### Resume Builder

- Standardized API endpoint usage in `resumeBuilderService.js`
- Enhanced error handling for resume data loading

### 4. Developer Tools Integration

- Set up CodeRabbit AI for automated code reviews via `.coderabbit.yaml`
- Configured JAM for debugging via `.jamrc`
- Implemented the `debug` npm package for enhanced logging

## Verification

- Confirmed backend health endpoint is accessible (`https://autoapplypro-backend-d14947a17c9b.herokuapp.com/api/health`)
- Verified API connectivity from the frontend application
- Tested dashboard, history, job tracker, and resume builder sections with success

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring application performance with JAM
- Use CodeRabbit AI reviews for future code changes
- Consider implementing additional error tracking and reporting mechanisms
- Regularly review and refine error handling strategies
