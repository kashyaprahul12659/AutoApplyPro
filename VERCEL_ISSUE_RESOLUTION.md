# Vercel vs Heroku Deployment Issue Resolution

## Issue Identified
Vercel is automatically adding SSO authentication to our deployment, making it inaccessible for public API usage. The authentication page shows "Authentication Required" which blocks API access.

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Switch to Heroku (Recommended)
Heroku provides true free hosting without forced authentication for APIs.

```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
npm install -g heroku

# Login and deploy
heroku login
heroku create autoapplypro-backend
git push hercel master
```

### Option 2: Configure Vercel (Complex)
Would require modifying project settings or using different project structure, but may still have limitations for API access.

### Option 3: Railway (Alternative)
Railway provides $5 free credit monthly and has excellent CLI.

## Recommendation
Switch to **Heroku** for the backend deployment since:
1. ✅ True free tier without authentication barriers
2. ✅ Perfect for API backends
3. ✅ Reliable CLI tools
4. ✅ Easy environment variable management
5. ✅ Better suited for Express.js applications

## Next Steps
1. Install Heroku CLI
2. Create Heroku app
3. Deploy backend to Heroku
4. Test API endpoints
5. Update frontend to use Heroku backend URL
